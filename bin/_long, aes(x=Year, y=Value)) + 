     ...: Arguments passed on to ‘discrete_scale’

          palette A palette function that when called with a single
              integer argument (the number of levels in the scale)
              returns the values that they should take.

          breaks One of:

                • ‘NULL’ for no breaks

                • ‘waiver()’ for the default breaks computed by the
                  transformation object

                • A character vector of breaks

                • A function that takes the limits as input and returns
                  breaks as output

          limits A character vector that defines possible values of the
              scale and their order.

          drop Should unused factor levels be omitted from the scale?
              The default, ‘TRUE’, uses the levels that appear in the
              data; ‘FALSE’ uses all the levels in the factor.

          na.translate Unlike continuous scales, discrete scales can
              easily show missing values, and do so by default. If you
              want to remove missing values from a discrete scale,
              specify ‘na.translate = FALSE’.

          aesthetics The names of the aesthetics that this scale works
              with

          scale_name The name of the scale

          name The name of the scale. Used as the axis or legend title.
              If ‘waiver()’, the default, the name of the scale is
              taken from the first mapping used for that aesthetic. If
              ‘NULL’, the legend title will be omitted.

          labels One of:

                • ‘NULL’ for no labels

                • ‘waiver()’ for the default labels computed by the
                  transformation object

                • A character vector giving labels (must be same length
                  as ‘breaks’)

                • A function that takes the breaks as input and returns
                  labels as output

          guide A function used to create a guide or its name. See
              ‘guides()’ for more info.

          super The super class to use for the constructed scale

na.value: The linetype to use for ‘NA’ values.
