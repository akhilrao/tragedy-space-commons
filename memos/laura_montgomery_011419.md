# CALL WITH LAURA MONTGOMERY (SPACE LAWYER)

Space Data Association on Isle of Man

# Leakage

- launch leakage prevented by:

1. US entities need license to launch (launch provider)
2. ITAR sends dual-use technology folks back (launch providers get sent back)
3. FCC spectrum rules on satellite providers

# Article 6 and 9

not quite, this is a no-go

can't reinterpret - consult means consult. "words mean what they mean - no Humpty Dumpty"

# Liability

not quite?

Liabilities on nation-states when they are a "launching state". 4 ways for NATION to be a launching state
1. NATION's govt itself launches
2. NATION's facilities are used
3. NATION's territories are used
4. you launch on someone else's vehicle(? need to clarify)

tests for absolute liability:
1. outer space is fault-based, someone had to be negligent; if no one is negligent, no one is at fault. US might have to pay if Hughes sat does damage. satellite operators don't have that, only launch operators (FCC and NOAA don't have that statutory authority)

liability convention talks about two types: 
1. absolute liability (hit something not in space, you just pay; equivalent to strict liability, or so we think)
2. fault-based system (also untested) - what is best practice? first court case will set precedents for what fault means here. open question of negligent relative to what?

## Could a new treaty define what the best practice is?

international efforts on "sustainability front": groups trying to do guidelines.

is there precedent for using guidelines in fault assessment? probably in some industries; standard-setting organizations e.g. ASTM for aircraft (call them and ask if industry standards used in litigation), maybe chemical industry, maybe electronics, maybe explosives (national fire protection something beginning with A).
	open issue here: compliance. is it really a standard if no one follows it?
